# Ships,,,,,
ef_quest,SHIP,"A design made to supplant the aging Conquest-class battlecruiser, sharing the mobility, weak shields and armor of the Conquest but providing all of the firepower, at the same price as a Conquest. The Domain Naval Bureau asking 'How is this different from a Conquest?' and subsequent lack of answer led to the resignation of multiple admirals.

The League found the blueprints in a ruined world. They function as an alternative to the Conquest due to their ability to mount a large energy weapon. They became produced following the League's Mjolnr Procurement Fiasco of '05, which saw the Mjolnr Cannon as both their only meaningful ballistic weapon and their only primary armament for Conquests. ",,,
ef_fluorescence,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the TriTachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it. The Fluorescent-class light cruiser acts as a skirmishing element, supporting the heavier Brilliant classes. Built aroun the heavier energy mount, it

ef_reinforcer,SHIP,"A heavy cruiser, often used in place of a capital in smaller fleets. ",,,
ef_necropolis,SHIP,"A dead, lifeless thing.",,,
ef_graveyard,SHIP,"A dead, lifeless thing.",,,
ef_crypt,SHIP,"A dead, lifeless thing.",,,
ef_tombstone,SHIP,"A dead, lifeless thing.",,,

# Systems,,,,,
ef_phaseshell,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Warps phasespace around the ship, reducing damage and increasing timeflow. Real-space speed remains the same. ",,,
ef_blastdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,Propels the ship forward in a burst of exreme speed.,,,

# Weapons,,,,,
ef_gravculverin_large,WEAPON,"A massive cannon, capable of overloading the shield generators of smaller craft in a single volley. Gravitic-infused projectiles cause adverse reactions to shields, and the huge shells can punch through anything short of a battleship's armor.",,,
ef_gravculverin_medium,WEAPON,"A heavy cannon, capable of incredible bursts of damage. Gravitic-infused projectiles cause adverse reactions to shields, and the shells can punch through frigate-grade armor.",,,
ef_gravculverin_small,WEAPON,"A cannon, capable of ruinious damage to the flux grid of anything hit by it, and anything firing it. Gravitic-infused projectiles cause adverse reactions to shields, and the shells can threaten frigate-grade armor.",,,
,,,,,
ef_hellrail_large,WEAPON,"A massive railgun that fires short lived, hyper-compressed plasma fields at extreme velocity. ",,,
ef_hellrail_medium,WEAPON,"A railgun that fires short lived, hyper-compressed plasma fields at extreme velocity. ",,,
ef_hellrail_small,WEAPON,"A diminutive railgun that fires short lived, hyper-compressed plasma fields at extreme velocity. ",,,
,,,,,
ef_galv_large,WEAPON,"The sheer output of electro-magnetic shells can threaten shield generators, lighter armor, and devastate exposed hull.",,,
ef_galv_medium,WEAPON,"The output of electro-magnetic shells can threaten shield generators, lighter armor, and destroy exposed hull.",,,
ef_galv_small,WEAPON,"The output of electro-magnetic shells can threaten shield generators, and rip through lighter craft.",,,
ef_galv_pd,WEAPON,Engages missiles in bursts,,,

ef_magcannon_medium,WEAPON,"Magnetically accelerates shells, tearing down shields in a barrage.",,,
ef_magcannon_small,WEAPON,"Magnetically accelerates shells, useful for tearing down shields.",,,
