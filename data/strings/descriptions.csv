# Ships,,,,,
ef_quest,SHIP,"A design made to supplant the aging Conquest-class battlecruiser, sharing the mobility, weak shields and armor of the Conquest but providing all of the firepower, at the same price as a Conquest. The Domain Naval Bureau asking 'How is this different from a Conquest?' and subsequent lack of answer led to the resignation of multiple admirals.

The League found the blueprints in a ruined world. They function as an alternative to the Conquest due to their ability to mount a large energy weapon. They became produced following the League's Mjolnr Procurement Fiasco of '05, which saw the Mjolnr Cannon as both their only meaningful ballistic weapon and their only primary armament for Conquests. ",,,
ef_fluorescence,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the TriTachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it. The Fluorescent-class light cruiser acts as a skirmishing element, supporting the heavier Brilliant classes.

ef_reinforcer,SHIP,"A heavy cruiser, with heavy armor and big guns. It is often used in place of a capital in smaller fleets. ",,,
ef_borealis,SHIP," A heavy cruiser, touted as the single largest vessel capable of utilizing chrono-manipulative effects. Its complicated machinery and poor operating time means that it generally spends most of its time inside a hanger, even accounting for time dilation. However, the ",,,

ef_victus,SHIP,"A Retribution-class modified with heavier armor and a flak system pulled from an Invictus-class. The modifications are most likely Luddic Church in origin. Energy feeds criss-cross throughout the ship, and the signature Orion Drive and flak systems have been replaced by a spacial manipulator and electric field canisters that are decidedly not Luddic Church.",,,
