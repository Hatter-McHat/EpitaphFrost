# Ships,,,,,
ef_quest,SHIP,"A design made to supplant the aging Conquest-class battlecruiser, sharing the mobility, weak shields and armor of the Conquest but providing all of the firepower, at the same price as a Conquest. The Domain Naval Bureau asking 'How is this different from a Conquest?' and subsequent lack of answer led to the resignation of multiple admirals.

The League found the blueprints in a ruined world. They function as an alternative to the Conquest due to their ability to mount a large energy weapon. They became produced following the League's Mjolnr Procurement Fiasco of '05, which saw the Mjolnr Cannon as both their only meaningful ballistic weapon and their only primary armament for Conquests. ",,,
ef_fluorescence,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it. The Fluorescent-class light cruiser acts as a skirmishing element, supporting the heavier Brilliant classes. 

",,,
ef_reinforcer,SHIP,"A heavy cruiser, with heavy armor and big guns. It is often used in place of a capital in smaller fleets. ",,,
ef_borealis,SHIP,"A heavy cruiser, derived from an Aurora-class with the temporal manipulation systems of an Anubis-class cruiser and a logistical footprint bigger than both of them.",,,
ef_stheno,SHIP,The Stheno was designed as an alternative for the Medusa. Sacrificing the Medusa's mobility for less expense and the ability to mount much heavier firepower. ,,,
ef_khepri,SHIP,"Spawned from the same black pit as the Anubis-class, the white-elephant concept Khepri-class battlecruiser came into existence by favoring scope creep over any design compromise. Possesses the firepower of an entire star fortress.",,,
